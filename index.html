			I'm a multi-disciplinary digital designer specializing in user centered design and research. I advocate for design thinking and believe in testing often and early. I design for desktop, tablet, mobile and large touchscreen. Clients include AIG, American Express, Verizon, Details, Discover and Christie's.
